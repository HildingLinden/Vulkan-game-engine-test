# Vulkan game engine
This aim of this project is to learn how to make a game engine from scratch as well as learn how to use the Vulkan graphics API.  

# Versions
- 2D-engine branch - my first attempt at using the Vulkan API and can draw rectangles with textures on them  
- 3D-engine branch - a rebuilt engine using the knowledge gained from the first try and some new optimisation techniques  

As the name suggests the physics and graphics of the first engine is only in two dimensions while the newer is 3D.
