Faster UBO/SSBO updates by partially updating buffers/memory
Dynamically scale size of UBO/SSBO
	createDescriptorSets
	createShaderBuffer
	addRects? to set the new pointers

Reuse Vertex/Index buffers

TimeStamp/performance query

each object has physics & graphics components, optionally an input component

gameloop() {
	either fixed time step with variable rendering
	or variable time step
}

Research if swapchainImage count can change when recreating swapchain
